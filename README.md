# Shutdown Timer

A small utility created to solve my own everyday problem.  
I have a TV connected to my main PC, and whenever I switch screens to watch movies or play games, I want a **sleep function** that goes beyond a simple shutdown.  

This tool allows you not only to schedule a system shutdown, but also to **change display settings automatically** — making the transition between work and leisure smoother and more convenient.

## ✨ Features
- Schedule automatic **shutdown** of your PC.
- Automatically **switch display settings** when needed.
- Simple and lightweight — made just to scratch the itch.
